# Initial API plan

This is a high level overview of the endpoints we believe will be needed

## endpoints by page

__NOTE:__ all returns are json values in a json object

**Landing Page**
GET /v1/cases
* returns a list of cases based on the users `office_code`
* filtering?
* pagination?

**Start a new case**
POST /v1/cases
* return UFN as unique identifier
* return page as `claiming_for`
* should this return the list of claim types or is that know by the FE

**Firm Details page** - repeat this for each page as specified below (I have not listed each endpoint here but can if required)
POST /v1/case/{UFN}/claiming_for
on success
* return UFN
* return page as `firm_details`
* return data for `firm_details` page

## Questions

* Do we want to expose the list of claim reasons from the BE or is this Hardcoded in the FE?
    * if it is returned from the BE do we want need a admin area to edit the option?
    * if we do who has admin access and can update this list?
* same for case_disposal reasons
